# Optimized-Standards

The motivation for this for this challenge is my future and the golas that I plan to achieve to create that future. 
Learning to code and become a full-stack web developer will ensure that I can make a career change that will better my overall work/balance life. 
Working 80 hours per week on a salary is a very powerful motivation to put my focus on coding to make my career change.

The problems solved here are not 100% solved, but what I did find was that some of the CSS could have been grouped better in accorance with the html.
While I did not change too much of the code, I did what I could do at this time. 

What was learned from this challenge is that I have much more to learn. 1 small change that you make could alter the web page as a whole, and no matter how much you look at the code and cross refference it, the answers on how to fix
what was disrupted will not stand out.
